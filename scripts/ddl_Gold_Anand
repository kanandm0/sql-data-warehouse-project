-- If a dimension table doesn't contain a primary key, then you can create one in SQL itself which called as surrogate key
-- Surrogate key - System generated unique identifier that is assigned to each record
-- Windows function ROW NUMBER helps creating a surrogate key
-- Good practice - Gold layer is always a virtual one
